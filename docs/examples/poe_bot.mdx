---

### ðŸš€ Getting started

1. Install embedchain python package:

```bash
pip install "embedchain[poe]"
```

2. Create a free account on [Poe](https://www.poe.com?utm_source=embedchain).
3. Click "Create Bot" button on top left.
4. Give it a handle and an optional description.
5. Select `Use API`.
6. Under `API URL` enter your server or ngrok address. You can use your machine's public IP or DNS. Otherwise, employ a proxy server like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local bot accessible.
7. Copy your api key and paste it in `.env` as `POE_API_KEY`.
8. Now create your bot using the following code snippet

```bash
from embedchain import PoeBot

poe_bot = PoeBot()

# add as many data sources as you want
poe_bot.add("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_D%27Angelo")
poe_bot.add("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJQVAqmKua8")

# start the bot
# this start the poe bot server on port 8080 by default
poe_bot.start()
```

9. You can refer the [Supported Data formats](https://docs.embedchain.ai/advanced/data_types) section to refer the supported data types in embedchain.

10. Click `Run check` to make sure your machine can be reached.
11. Make sure your bot is private if that's what you want.
12. Click `Create bot` at the bottom to finally create the bot
13. Now you bot is created.

### ðŸ’¬ How to use

- To ask the bot questions, just type your query in the Poe interface:
```text
<your-question-here>
```

- If you wish to add more data source to the bot, simply update your script and add as many `.add` as you like. You need to restart the server.
