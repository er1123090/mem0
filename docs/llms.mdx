## OpenAI

To use OpenAI LLM models, you have to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can obtain the OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Once you have obtained the key, you can use it like this:

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'xxx'

config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "config": {
            "model": "gpt-4o",
            "temperature": 0.2,
            "max_tokens": 1500,
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
m.add("Likes to play cricket on weekends", user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "hobbies"})
```

## Groq

[Groq](https://groq.com/) is the creator of the world's first Language Processing Unit (LPU), providing exceptional speed performance for AI workloads running on their LPU Inference Engine.

In order to use LLMs from Groq, go to their [platform](https://console.groq.com/keys) and get the API key. Set the API key as `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable to use the model as given below in the example.

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

os.environ['GROQ_API_KEY'] = 'xxx'

config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "groq",
        "config": {
            "model": "mixtral-8x7b-32768",
            "temperature": 0.1,
            "max_tokens": 1000,
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
m.add("Likes to play cricket on weekends", user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "hobbies"})
```

## TogetherAI

To use TogetherAI LLM models, you have to set the `TOGETHER_API_KEY` environment variable. You can obtain the TogetherAI API key from their [Account settings page](https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys).

Once you have obtained the key, you can use it like this:

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

os.environ['TOGETHER_API_KEY'] = 'xxx'

config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "togetherai",
        "config": {
            "model": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1",
            "temperature": 0.2,
            "max_tokens": 1500,
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
m.add("Likes to play cricket on weekends", user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "hobbies"})
```
