Mem0 offers support for various embedding models, allowing users to choose the one that best suits their needs.

## Usage

To utilize a embedder, you must provide a configuration to customize its usage. If no configuration is supplied, a default configuration will be applied, and `OpenAI` will be used as the embedder.

For a comprehensive list of available parameters for embedder configuration, please refer to [Config](./config).

To view all supported embedders, visit the [Supported embedders](./models).
