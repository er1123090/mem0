[xAI](https://x.ai/) is a new AI company founded by Elon Musk that develops large language models, including Grok. Grok is trained on real-time data from X (formerly Twitter) and aims to provide accurate, up-to-date responses with a touch of wit and humor.

In order to use LLMs from xAI, go to their [platform](https://console.x.ai) and get the API key. Set the API key as `XAI_API_KEY` environment variable to use the model as given below in the example.

## Usage

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key" # used for embedding model
os.environ["XAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"

config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "xai",
        "config": {
            "model": "grok-2-latest",
            "temperature": 0.1,
            "max_tokens": 2000,
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
m.add("Likes to play cricket on weekends", user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "hobbies"})
```

## Config

All available parameters for the `xai` config are present in [Master List of All Params in Config](../config).
