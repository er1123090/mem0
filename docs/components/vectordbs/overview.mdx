Mem0 includes built-in support for various popular databases. Memory can utilize the database provided by the user, ensuring efficient use for specific needs.

## Usage

To utilize a vector database, you must provide a configuration to customize its usage. If no configuration is supplied, a default configuration will be applied, and `Qdrant` will be used as the vector database.

For a comprehensive list of available parameters for vector database configuration, please refer to [Config](./config).

To view all supported vector databases, visit the [Supported Vector Databases](./dbs).

## Common issues

### Using model with different dimensions

If you are using customized model, which is having different dimensions other than 1536
for example 768, you may encounter below error:

`ValueError: shapes (0,1536) and (768,) not aligned: 1536 (dim 1) != 768 (dim 0)`

you could add `"embedding_model_dims": 768,` to the config of the vector_store to overcome this issue.
