After successfully setting up and testing your Embedchain application locally, the next step is to deploy it to a hosting service to make it accessible to a wider audience. This section offers various options for hosting your app on the [Embedchain platform](https://app.embedchain.ai) or through [self-hosting options](#self-hosting).

## Option 1: Deploy on Embedchain Platform

Embedchain enables developers to deploy their LLM-powered apps in production using the [Embedchain platform](https://app.embedchain.ai). The platform offers free access to context on your data through its REST API. Once the pipeline is deployed, you can update your data sources anytime after deployment.

See the example below on how to use the deploy your app (for free):

```python
from embedchain import Pipeline as App

# Initialize app
app = App()

# Add data source
app.add("https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk")

# Deploy your pipeline to Embedchain Platform
app.deploy()

# üîë Enter your Embedchain API key. You can find the API key at https://app.embedchain.ai/settings/keys/
# ec-xxxxxx

# üõ†Ô∏è Creating pipeline on the platform...
# üéâüéâüéâ Pipeline created successfully! View your pipeline: https://app.embedchain.ai/pipelines/xxxxx

# üõ†Ô∏è Adding data to your pipeline...
# ‚úÖ Data of type: web_page, value: https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk added successfully.
```

## Option 2: Self-hosting

You can also deploy Embedchain as a self-hosted service using the dockerized REST API service that we provide. Please follow the [guide here](/examples/rest-api) on how to use the REST API service. Here are some tutorials on how to deploy a containerized application to different platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure etc:
