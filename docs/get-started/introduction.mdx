## üåê What is Embedchain?

Embedchain simplifies data handling by automatically processing unstructured data, breaking it into chunks, generating embeddings, and storing it in a vector database.

Through various APIs, you can obtain contextual information for queries, find answers to specific questions, and engage in chat conversations using your data.
## üîç Search

Embedchain lets you get most relevant context by doing semantic search over your data sources for a provided query. See the example below:

```python
from embedchain import Pipeline as App

# Initialize app
app = App()

# Add data source
app.add("https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk")

# Get relevant context using semantic search
context = app.search("What is the net worth of Elon?", num_documents=2)
print(context)
# Context:

#     {

#     }
# ]
```

## ‚ùìQuery

Embedchain empowers developers to ask questions and receive relevant answers through a user-friendly query API. Refer to the following example to learn how to utilize the query API:

<CodeGroup>

```python With Citations
from embedchain import Pipeline as App

# Initialize app
app = App()

# Add data source
app.add("https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk")

# Get relevant answer for your query
answer, sources = app.query("What is the net worth of Elon?", citations=True)
print(answer)
# Answer: The net worth of Elon Musk is $221.9 billion.

print(sources)
# [
#    (
#        'Elon Musk PROFILEElon MuskCEO, Tesla$247.1B$2.3B (0.96%)Real Time Net Worthas of 12/7/23 ...',
#        'https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk',
#        '4651b266--4aa78839fe97'
#    ),
#    (
#        '74% of the company, which is now called X.Wealth HistoryHOVER TO REVEAL NET WORTH BY YEARForbes ...',
#        'https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk',
#        '4651b266--4aa78839fe97'
#    ),
#    (
#        'founded in 2002, is worth nearly $150 billion after a $750 million tender offer in June 2023 ...',
#        'https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk',
#        '4651b266--4aa78839fe97'
#    )
# ]
```


```python Without Citations
from embedchain import Pipeline as App

# Initialize app
app = App()

# Add data source
app.add("https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk")

# Get relevant answer for your query
answer = app.query("What is the net worth of Elon?")
print(answer)
# Answer: The net worth of Elon Musk is $221.9 billion.
```

</CodeGroup>

When `citations=True`, note that the returned `sources` are a list of tuples where each tuple has three elements (in the following order):
1. source chunk
2. link of the source document
3. document id (used for book keeping purposes)


## üí¨ Chat

Embedchain allows easy chatting over your data sources using a user-friendly chat API. Check out the example below to understand how to use the chat API:

<CodeGroup>

```python With Citations
from embedchain import Pipeline as App

# Initialize app
app = App()

# Add data source
app.add("https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk")

# Get relevant answer for your query
answer, sources = app.chat("What is the net worth of Elon?", citations=True)
print(answer)
# Answer: The net worth of Elon Musk is $221.9 billion.

print(sources)
# [
#    (
#        'Elon Musk PROFILEElon MuskCEO, Tesla$247.1B$2.3B (0.96%)Real Time Net Worthas of 12/7/23 ...',
#        'https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk',
#        '4651b266--4aa78839fe97'
#    ),
#    (
#        '74% of the company, which is now called X.Wealth HistoryHOVER TO REVEAL NET WORTH BY YEARForbes ...',
#        'https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk',
#        '4651b266--4aa78839fe97'
#    ),
#    (
#        'founded in 2002, is worth nearly $150 billion after a $750 million tender offer in June 2023 ...',
#        'https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk',
#        '4651b266--4aa78839fe97'
#    )
# ]
```

```python Without Citations
from embedchain import Pipeline as App

# Initialize app
app = App()

# Add data source
app.add("https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk")

# Chat on your data using `.chat()`
answer = app.chat("What is the net worth of Elon?")
print(answer)
# Answer: The net worth of Elon Musk is $221.9 billion.
```

</CodeGroup>

Similar to `query()` function, when `citations=True`, note that the returned `sources` are a list of tuples where each tuple has three elements (in the following order):
1. source chunk
2. link of the source document
3. document id (used for book keeping purposes)

## üöÄ Deploy

Embedchain enables developers to deploy their LLM-powered apps in production using the Embedchain platform. The platform offers free access to context on your data through its REST API. Once the pipeline is deployed, you can update your data sources anytime after deployment.

See the example below on how to use the deploy API:

```python
from embedchain import Pipeline as App

# Initialize app
app = App()

# Add data source
app.add("https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk")

# Deploy your pipeline to Embedchain Platform
app.deploy()

# üîë Enter your Embedchain API key. You can find the API key at https://app.embedchain.ai/settings/keys/
# ec-xxxxxx

# üõ†Ô∏è Creating pipeline on the platform...
# üéâüéâüéâ Pipeline created successfully! View your pipeline: https://app.embedchain.ai/pipelines/xxxxx

# üõ†Ô∏è Adding data to your pipeline...
# ‚úÖ Data of type: web_page, value: https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk added successfully.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How it works?

Embedchain abstracts out the following steps from you to easily create LLM powered apps:

1. Detect the data type and load data
2. Create meaningful chunks
3. Create embeddings for each chunk
4. Store chunks in a vector database

When a user asks a query, the following process happens to find the answer:

1. Create an embedding for the query
2. Find similar documents for the query from the vector database
3. Pass the similar documents as context to LLM to get the final answer

The process of loading the dataset and querying involves multiple steps, each with its own nuances:

- How should I chunk the data? What is a meaningful chunk size?
- How should I create embeddings for each chunk? Which embedding model should I use?
- How should I store the chunks in a vector database? Which vector database should I use?
- Should I store metadata along with the embeddings?
- How should I find similar documents for a query? Which ranking model should I use?

Embedchain takes care of all these nuances and provides a simple interface to create apps on any data.
