import { Memory } from 'mem0ai/oss';

const config = {
  llm: {
    provider: 'groq',
    config: {
      apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY || '',
      model: 'mixtral-8x7b-32768',
      temperature: 0.1,
      maxTokens: 1000,
    },
  },
};

const memory = new Memory(config);
await memory.add("Likes to play cricket on weekends", { userId: "alice", metadata: { category: "hobbies" } });
```
