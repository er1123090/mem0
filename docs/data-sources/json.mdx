title: 'ðŸ“ƒ JSON'
---

To add any json file, use the data_type as `json`. `json` allows remote urls and conventional file paths. Headers are included for each line, so if you have an `age` column, `18` will be added as `age: 18`. Eg:

```python
import os

from embedchain.apps.app import App

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "openai_api_key"

app = App()

response = app.query("What is the net worth of Elon Musk as of October 2023?")

print(response)
"I'm sorry, but I don't have access to real-time information or future predictions. Therefore, I don't know the net worth of Elon Musk as of October 2023."

source_id = app.add("temp.json")

response = app.query("What is the net worth of Elon Musk as of October 2023?")

print(response)
"As of October 2023, Elon Musk's net worth is $255.2 billion."
```

```temp.json
{
    "question": "What is your net worth, Elon Musk?",
    "answer": "As of October 2023, Elon Musk's net worth is $255.2 billion, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in the world."
}
```
